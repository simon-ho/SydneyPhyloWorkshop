# [Sydney Phylogenetics Workshop](https://meep.sydney.edu.au/workshops/)

The materials in this repository are from the [13th annual Sydney Phylogenetics Workshop](https://meep.sydney.edu.au/workshops/), held as an online event on 27â€“29 July 2022. 

This 3-day online workshop provides an introduction to phylogenetic analysis, including practical exercises based on the software MEGA, IQ-TREE, BEAST 2, and ASTRAL. It is primarily aimed at early career researchers (research students and postdoctoral researchers). Prior knowledge of basic phylogenetics is very helpful but not essential.

The workshop comprises a series of lectures and practical exercises, held over three days. Day 1 of the workshop provides an introduction to phylogenetics, covering evolutionary models, phylogenetic data, and phylogenetic analysis. Day 2 covers maximum-likelihood analysis using IQ-TREE and Bayesian phylogenetic analysis. Day 3 covers molecular dating and phylogenomics. 

Most of the workshop materials were written by Simon Ho, with input from various contributors over the years (including Matt Phillips, Rob Lanfear, Sebastian Duchene, David Duchene, Mark de Bruyn, Nate Lo, and members of the [Molecular Ecology, Evolution, and Phylogenetics research group](https://meep.sydney.edu.au/) at the University of Sydney).
