# [Sydney Phylogenetics Workshop](https://meep.sydney.edu.au/workshops/)

This free workshop provides an introduction to phylogenetic analysis, including practical exercises based on the software MEGA, IQ-TREE, BEAST2, and ASTRAL. It is suitable for research students, postdoctoral researchers, and academics. Prior knowledge of basic phylogenetics is helpful but not essential. 

The workshop comprises a series of lectures and practical exercises, usually held over two days. Day 1 covers interpreting phylogenetic trees, molecular data, sequence alignment, evolutionary models, and phylogenetic methods. Day 2 provides an introduction to Bayesian phylogenetic analysis and includes Bayesian statistics, priors, molecular dating, and phylogenomics. 

Workshop materials were written by Simon Ho, with input from various contributors over the years (including Matt Phillips, Rob Lanfear, Sebastian Duchene, David Duchene, Mark de Bruyn, Nate Lo, and members of the Molecular Ecology, Evolution, and Phylogenetics research group at the University of Sydney).

The materials in this repository are from the [12th annual Sydney Phylogenetics Workshop](https://meep.sydney.edu.au/workshops/), which will be held as an online event on 29â€“30 July 2021. An online version of Practical 2.2 is available [here](http://www.iqtree.org/workshop/molevol2019).
