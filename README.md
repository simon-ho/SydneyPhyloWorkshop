# [Sydney Phylogenetics Workshop](https://meep.sydney.edu.au/workshops/)

The materials in this repository are from the [16th annual Sydney Phylogenetics Workshop](https://meep.sydney.edu.au/workshops/), which was held at the University of Sydney on 26–27 June 2025. 

This 2-day workshop provided an introduction to phylogenetic analysis, including practical exercises based on the software MEGA, IQ-TREE, ASTRAL, and BEAST 2. It was aimed at early career researchers (research students and postdoctoral researchers). 

The workshop comprised a series of lectures and practical exercises. Day 1 dealt with interpreting phylogenetic trees, molecular evolution, phylogenetic data, sequence alignment, evolutionary models, and phylogenetic methods. Day 2 provided an introduction to phylogenomics, Bayesian phylogenetic analysis, and estimating timescales. 

Most of the workshop materials were written by Simon Ho, with input from various contributors over the years (including Matt Phillips, Rob Lanfear, Sebastian Duchêne, David Duchêne, Mark de Bruyn, Nate Lo, Minh Bui, and members of the [Molecular Ecology, Evolution, and Phylogenetics Lab](https://meep.sydney.edu.au/) at the University of Sydney).
