# [Sydney Phylogenetics Workshop](https://meep.sydney.edu.au/workshops/)

The materials in this repository are from the [15th annual Sydney Phylogenetics Workshop](https://meep.sydney.edu.au/workshops/), to be held at the University of Sydney on 27–28 June 2024. 

This 2-day workshop provides an introduction to phylogenetic analysis, including practical exercises based on the software MEGA, IQ-TREE, ASTRAL, and BEAST 2. It is aimed at early career researchers (research students and postdoctoral researchers). 

The workshop comprises a series of lectures and practical exercises. Day 1 deals with interpreting phylogenetic trees, molecular evolution, phylogenetic data, sequence alignment, evolutionary models, and phylogenetic methods. Day 2 provided an introduction to phylogenomics, Bayesian phylogenetic analysis, and estimating timescales. 

Most of the workshop materials were written by Simon Ho, with input from various contributors over the years (including Matt Phillips, Rob Lanfear, Sebastian Duchêne, David Duchêne, Mark de Bruyn, Nate Lo, Minh Bui, and members of the [Molecular Ecology, Evolution, and Phylogenetics Lab](https://meep.sydney.edu.au/) at the University of Sydney). 

The next workshop will be held in late 2025, most likely in hybrid format to allow remote attendees to watch the lectures.
