# [Sydney Phylogenetics Workshop](https://meep.sydney.edu.au/workshops/)

This free workshop provides an introduction to phylogenetic analysis, including practical exercises based on the software MEGA and BEAST2. It is suitable for research students, postdoctoral researchers, and academics. Prior knowledge of basic phylogenetics is helpful but not essential. 

The workshop comprises a series of lectures and practical exercises, usually held over two days. Day 1 covers interpreting phylogenetic trees, molecular data, sequence alignment, evolutionary models, and phylogenetic methods. Day 2 provides an introduction to Bayesian phylogenetic analysis and includes Bayesian statistics, priors, and molecular dating.

Workshop materials were written by Simon Ho, with input from various contributors over the years (including Matt Phillips, Rob Lanfear, Sebastian Duchene, David Duchene, Mark de Bruyn, Nate Lo, and members of the Molecular Ecology, Evolution, and Phylogenetics research group at the University of Sydney).

The materials in this repository are from the [11th annual Sydney Phylogenetics Workshop](https://meep.sydney.edu.au/workshops/), held as an online event on 28–29 January 2021.
